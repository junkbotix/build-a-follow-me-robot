## About the GM Delco 5503740 Gearmotor

![GM Delco Gearmotors](./images/gm-delco-motors-720px.jpg)

I'm using these gearmotors for my "follow-me" robot platform because I've found them to be almost the perfect drive motor for hobbyist robotics. They are inexpensive, easy to modify into left and right-hand orientation (of the shaft), and have excellent torque and speed characteristics.

## Specifications

It should be noted that these specifications are a combination of various vendor specs, along with other third-party measurements. While I can't claim to say they are 100% accurate, I do believe they are as close as one can get, since the real specs are virtually unpublished.

* P/N 5503740, (alt: 200683N)
* 6/12/24 VDC
* 1.5A no load, 17A/25A stall @ 12V
* 88/178/380 RPM (190 rpm?) - no load
* 1/3 HP (12VDC * 25A = 300W; 300W / 746W/HP = ~0.4HP) 
* Available in Right Hand (SK1640) or Left Hand(SK1641) configurations
